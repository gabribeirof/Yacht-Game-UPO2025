YACHT (DICE GAME)
=================
GAMEPLAY CLASSIC:
1.  The game consists of twelve rounds.
2.  In each turn, a player rolls five dice up to three times.
3.  After each turn, the player chooses which scoring category to use.
4.  Once a category is used, it cannot be used again.
5.  A Yacht is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points (the highest category).
6.  The winner is the player with the most points.
GAMEPLAY EXTENDED:
1.  Three-phase variant structure: Downward, 1st Roll, and Free, with three
    corresponding columns on the scoreboard for each player
2.  Downward phase: strict top-to-bottom filling of the column (starting
    from Ones), requiring players to score even when suboptimal (example: with
    you must score 0 in Ones)
3.  1st Roll phase: only one dice roll allowed per turn ("dry hits"), with
    choice constrained to categories matching the first roll result
    (example: with you choose among Ones, Fours, Full House, or Choice)
4.  Free phase: complete freedom in choosing categories to fill the column,
    as in the classic version of the game
5.  Common rule for all phases: must score 0 points in an available category
    when the combination doesn't match any remaining category
6.  Turn order: determined randomly at the start of the game and kept fixed
    for all phases and all rounds
7.  Yacht scoring note: cannot be obtained with a Full House, but can be obtained
    with a Four of a Kind (though the fifth die is not counted in the score)
