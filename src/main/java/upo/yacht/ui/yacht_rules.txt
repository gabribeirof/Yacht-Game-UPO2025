YACHT (DICE GAME)
=================
GAMEPLAY CLASSIC:
___The goal of the game is to score points by rolling five six-sided dice to
achieve certain combinations. The possible combinations are divided into
twelve categories, whose list is shown in Table 1. The categories have
point values, some of which are fixed regardless of the dice values
(e.g., "Yacht" always yields 50 points), while others depend on the dice values
(e.g., the value obtained with "Choice" is calculated by summing the dice
values).

___A game takes place over twelve rounds, one after another, each of
which is divided into turns where players take turns rolling the five dice.
At the end of each turn, the player records the score obtained on a
scorecard. Which has thirteen rows (one for each category and one for the
overall total points) and at least two columns—the first ("Category") lists
the combination categories. While the remaining columns list the players'
scores in the various categories (one column per player).

___In each turn, the player can roll the dice up to three times to try to
obtain one of the combinations shown in Table 1. Specifically, on the first
roll the player rolls all the dice, while in the subsequent two rolls the
player can decide to keep one or more dice that are favorable to achieving the
desired combination. For example, if on the first dice roll the player obtained,
they could decide to roll the dice again to try to get at least a "Full House,"
re-rolling only the first, fourth, and fifth dice.

___The player can also choose not to keep any dice or, in case a favorable
combination has already been achieved, to make no further rolls in that turn.
For example, if on the first dice roll the player obtained, they could decide
to make no further rolls and record a "Full House" on the scorecard.

___At the end of the three rolls, the player must record—compulsorily—in one
of the still-unused boxes on the scoresheet the score associated with the
chosen combination. Some combinations allow the player to decide in which
category to record them; for example, the combination [1,1,1,2,2] could be
recorded in the “Full House,” “Ones,” “Twos,” or “Choice” categories. If, at the
end of the turn, none of the possible combinations that are still available
on the scoresheet (i.e., not previously selected by the player) has been
achieved, the player must record 00 points (i.e., a zero score) in one of the
boxes that remains available.

___Since a combination cannot be repeated, the game ends after twelve
dice-rolling turns, even if not all combinations have been achieved. At the
end of the twelfth round, the player with the highest total score wins. The
players’ order is determined randomly at the start of the game and remains
fixed for all rounds.

GAMEPLAY EXTENDED:
___A variant of the classic game consists of dividing the game into three
phases, called "Downward", "1st Roll" and "Free", to be played one after
another in the specified order and corresponding to three different columns
on the scorecard (for each player), as shown in Table 3.

___Specifically:
______In the "Downward" phase, the corresponding column on the scorecard
must be filled strictly from top to bottom (therefore starting with the
"Ones" category, then "Twos", etc.). For example, if in the first turn a player
obtains the combination , they must mandatorily score 0 points in the cell
corresponding to the "Ones" category on the scorecard. If, instead, they obtain,
they must score 3 points in the "Ones" category on the scorecard.
______In the "1st Roll" phase, players can only make "single shots", meaning
only one die roll per turn. Therefore, the corresponding column will be filled
based on the combinations obtained on the first dice roll. For example, if in
a turn a player obtains the combination on the first roll. They must choose
on the scorecard one of the still-available categories among "Ones", "Fours",
"Full House" and "Choice" (or choose another available category, scoring 0
points), without any additional dice rolls in that turn.
______In the "Free" phase, the choice of category is unrestricted, just like in
the classic version of the game. Therefore, the corresponding column can be
filled in whatever way a player deems appropriate, depending on the
combinations obtained.

___For each of the aforementioned phases, the rule always applies that if the
combination obtained from the dice roll does not have a corresponding available
category on the scorecard, the player scores 0 points in one of the
available categories.

___The order of players is established randomly at the beginning of the game and
remains fixed for all phases and all rounds.
